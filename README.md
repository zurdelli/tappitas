# T*app*itas

**Tappitas** is an Android app to manage a collection of beer caps (or whatever drink who use a cap). 
The name comes from Latin American Spanish, where a cap is called *tapita*. The idea to make this project comes from my desire of manage [my collection of caps](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cv7x6cFrzBr/?img_index=1). This is a test project, so it could have many bugs.
